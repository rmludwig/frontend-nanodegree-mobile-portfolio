NOTES ON gh_pages


While not submited to Udacity, I am hosting this site on github pages just 
to gain experience with it. To keep changes in master update on the github
pages follow these steps.

Starting from the gh-pages brach (which is the code for Github Pages)

git branch
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout gh-pages
git merge master
git branch
git push
git branch
git status
